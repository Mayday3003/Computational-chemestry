The recently discovered Kagome superconductors AV<inf>3</inf>Sb<inf>5</inf> (A = K, Rb, Cs) have attracted widespread attention in the field of condensed matter physics, and many efforts have been made to elucidate their novel physical properties, such as charge density wave, unconventional superconductivity, and band topology. Meanwhile, many groups have effectively tuned these novel properties through chemical doping, offering a good opportunity for further understanding the materials of this system. In this paper, we comprehensively review the latest research progress of the doping effect of this rapidly developed AV<inf>3</inf>Sb<inf>5</inf> system, with the objective of further promoting the in-depth research into Kagome superconductor. Specifically, we review the chemical doping in CsV<inf>3</inf>Sb<inf>5</inf> with elements such as Nb, Ta, Ti, and Sn, and the surface doping with elements Cs or O as well, and describe their influences on the novel quantum properties, especially superconductivity, charge density wave, and electronic band structure of the material.

The PME was observed in field-cool cooling (FC-C) and field-cool warming (FC-W) (Formula presented.) -measurements on Al, Nb, Pb, Ta, in compounds such as, e.g., NbSe (Formula presented.), In-Sn, ZrB (Formula presented.), and others, and also in MgB (Formula presented.), the metallic superconductor with the highest transition temperature. Furthermore, samples with different shapes such as crystals, polycrystals, thin films, bi- and multilayers, nanocomposites, nanowires, mesoscopic objects, and porous materials exhibited the PME. The characteristic features of the PME, found mainly in Nb disks, such as the characteristic temperatures (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) and the apparative details of the various magnetic measurement techniques applied to observe the PME, are discussed. We also show that PME can be observed with the magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the sample surface, that PME can be removed by abrading the sample surface, and that PME can be introduced or enhanced by irradiation processes. The PME can be observed as well in magnetization loops (MHLs, (Formula presented.)) in a narrow temperature window (Formula presented.), which enables the construction of a phase diagram for a superconducting sample exhibiting the PME. We found that the Nb disks still exhibit the PME after more than 20 years, and we present the efforts of magnetic imaging techniques (scanning SQUID microscopy, magneto-optics, diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-center magnetometry, and low-energy muon spin spectroscopy, (LE- (Formula presented.) SR)). Various attempts to explain PME behavior are discussed in detail. In particular, magnetic measurements of mesoscopic Al disks brought out important details employing the models of a giant vortex state and flux compression. Thus, we consider these approaches and demagnetization effects as the base to understand the formation of the paramagnetic signals in most of the materials investigated.

Inspired by the extensive studies on the AV3Sb5 family of materials, here, we investigate the topological and superconducting properties of the bilayer kagome metal materials YT6Sn6 (T=V, Nb, Ta) using first-principles calculations. These kagome materials exhibit the MgFe6Ge6-prototype structure and have no magnetism. The calculated results for formation energy and the phonon dispersion spectrum demonstrate their stability. Based on the calculation of topologically invariant and surface states, they can be categorized as Z2 topological metals. The Van Hove singularity and Dirac points are also observed near the Fermi level. According to electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations, YT6Sn6 systems are all predicted to be weak superconductors. Using the Allen-Dynes modified McMillan formula, the superconducting critical temperatures Tc of YV6Sn6, YNb6Sn6, and YTa6Sn6 are predicted to be 0.65, 1.17, and 0.89 K, respectively. The EPC is mainly contributed by the vibrations of V atoms and partially by the out-of-plane vibrational modes of Sn atoms.

However, commonality of superconducting characteristics of HEA materials is unclear. Here, we have investigated the crystal and electronic structure, and the robustness of superconducting states in a HEA-type metal telluride (MTe; M = Ag, In, Sn, Pb, Bi) under high pressure, and the results were compared with the pressure effects for a middle-entropy system (AgPbBiTe<inf>3</inf>) and a reference system of PbTe. When the crystal structure is CsCl-type, all phases show superconductivity under high pressure but exhibit different pressure dependences of the transition temperature (T<inf>c</inf>). For PbTe, its T<inf>c</inf> decreases with pressure. In contrast, the T<inf>c</inf> of HEA-type AgInSnPbBiTe<inf>5</inf> is almost independent of pressure, for pressures ranging from 13.0 to 35.1 GPa. Those results suggest that the robustness of superconductivity to external pressure is linked to the configurational entropy of mixing at the M site in MTe. Since the trend is quite similar to previous work on a HEA (Ti–Zr–Hf–Nb–Ta), where the robustness of superconductivity was observed up to ~ 200 GPa, we propose that the robustness of superconductivity under high pressure would be a universal feature in HEA-type superconductors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","Nature Research","20452322","","","35552481","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130046895"

In this study, we investigated the microstructure and superconducting properties of bronze-processed Nb3Sn wires using an Nb-Ti-Hf alloy core/Cu-Sn matrix. The wires had a single-core structure for simplicity. Conventional structure wires with Nb-Ti/Cu-Sn and Nb/Cu-Sn-Ti diffusion couple combinations were also prepared as references. The direct Ti-Hf doping of the Nb core resulted in a better Jc property than direct Ti doping. However, the thickness of the Nb3Sn layer of the conventional external Ti-doped (Ti-bronze) wire sample was large. A high Ti composition in the Nb3Sn layer was also observed in this sample. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in the morphological features, although the addition of Ti-Hf, as well as Hf-Ta, to the Nb core resulted in an increase in the internal strain energy. Consequently, the layer Jc-B characteristic of the conventional Ti-bronze sample was the highest, and the impact of Ti-Hf doping was not significant in the bronze process compared with conventional external Ti doping. Thus, the Ti doping of the bronze matrix enhanced the Sn diffusion driving force, which had a relatively large impact on improving the Nb3Sn layer growth kinetics and grain refinement during the bronze process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bronze-processed; Diffusion Reaction; Micro-structure; Nb3sn; Ti-hf Doping; Binary Alloys; Bronze; Diffusion; Grain Refinement; Grain Size And Shape; Growth Kinetics; Morphology; Niobium Alloys; Strain Energy; Tantalum Alloys; Ternary Alloys; Titanium Alloys; Wire; Bronze Process; Bronze-processed; Diffusion-reaction; Hf Doping; Layer Formation; Micro-structures; Nb3sn Superconductor; Nb3sn Wire; Ti Doping; Ti-hf Doping; Microstructure","Binary alloys; Bronze; Diffusion; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Growth kinetics; Morphology; Niobium alloys; Strain energy; Tantalum alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Wire; Bronze process; Bronze-processed; Diffusion-reaction; Hf doping; Layer formation; Micro-structures; Nb3Sn superconductor; Nb3Sn wire; Ti doping; Ti-hf doping; Microstructure","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","10518223","","ITASE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127480143"

We have investigated the effect of ZrO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles formed by the internal oxidation of Zr on the superconducting properties and microstructure of Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn formed from Nb-1 wt%Zr, Nb-7.5 wt%Ta, Nb-7.5 wt%Ta-1 wt%Zr and Nb-7.5 wt%Ta-2 wt%Zr alloys. A monofilamentary wire configuration was used, with a 0.22 mm outer diameter Nb-alloy tube containing a core of powdered metal oxide (SnO<inf>2</inf>, CuO or MoO<inf>3</inf>) as oxygen source and successive deposits of Cu, Sn and Cu on the outer surface. As determined from inductive measurements, the layer critical current densities of the samples based on Nb alloys with internally oxidized Zr were superior to those based on Nb-7.5 wt%Ta. The samples based on Nb-7.5 wt%Ta-1 wt%Zr and Nb-7.5 wt%Ta-2 wt%Zr showed higher critical current densities at high magnetic fields (above 10-15 T), and upper critical fields exceeding 28.5 T at 4.2 K (99% normal state resistivity criterion). A record value of 29.2 T of the upper critical field at 4.2 K was obtained on samples based on Nb-7.5 wt%Ta-2 wt%Zr. Hypotheses are proposed and discussed for explaining this unexpected increase of the upper critical field, by considering the possible effects of non-oxidized Zr on the superconducting properties of Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn and of the oxidized Zr on the formation and microchemistry of Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn. Regardless of sample type the Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn grains observed in our samples have an aspect ratio of 1.5-1.7. When compared in the short axis direction, the mean distance between grain boundary intercepts (lineal intercept method) is ∼40% smaller in the samples with internally oxidized Zr than in the reference samples based on Nb-7.5 wt%Ta.

Here, we report calculations on bulk and few-layer PbTaSe2 using the first-principles anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory, to explore the nature of the superconducting gap and the surface-bulk proximity effect in this stoichiometric system. In bulk, the multiband Pb p/Ta d Fermi surface exhibits a single anisotropic full superconducting gap, with larger gap values appearing on in-plane orbitals that can couple effectively to the in-plane phonons. A Pb-terminated few-layer PbTaSe2 is found to still have a single-anisotropic-gap feature, but its superconducting gap is evidently reduced relative to the bulk case. Comparison between our theoretical results and experimental tunneling data suggests a significant proximity-enhanced superconductivity on the realistic surface of PbTaSe2. The present findings would apply to other same-structured ABSe2 (A = Pb, Sn; B = Ta, Nb) and are crucial for studying topological superconductors and Majorana fermions in promising topological metals with intrinsic full-gap superconductivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anisotropy; Calculations; Superconducting Materials; Tantalum Compounds; Tin Compounds; Topology; Anisotropic Gap; Eliashberg Theory; First Principles; Gap Values; Multi Band; Noncentrosymmetric Superconductors; Orbitals; Proximity Effects; Superconducting Gaps; Tunneling Data; Lead Compounds","Anisotropy; Calculations; Superconducting materials; Tantalum compounds; Tin compounds; Topology; Anisotropic gap; Eliashberg theory; First principles; Gap values; Multi band; Noncentrosymmetric superconductors; Orbitals; Proximity effects; Superconducting gaps; Tunneling data; Lead compounds","","American Physical Society","24699950; 24699969","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076805227"

PbTaSe2 simultaneously exhibits superconductivity and nontrivial Z2 topology without the need for doping or proximity effect. Scanning tunneling microscopy confirms that the topological surface states are gapped by superconductivity, indicating the likelihood of the chiral px+ipy pairing mechanism. Motivated by these exciting findings, we predict by means of the first-principles scheme that ABSe2 (A=Pb or Sn and B=Ta or Nb) is also a superconductor with nontrivial Z2 topology. Among these, SnNbSe2 shows the highest Tc∼7.0 K. Due to the fact that the required energy resolution to detect the Majorana bound states is of the order of Δ/F, the predicted higher Tc of ABSe2 may help mitigate some experimental challenges and provides a better platform for the exploration of the topological superconductivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","American Physical Society revtex@aps.org","24699950; 24699969","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992013405"

While most of the contacts with the strong superconductors Nb and Ta appear to be barely affected by the presence of Fe, the contacts with weaker superconductors Sn and Al have a reduced critical temperature T<inf>C</inf> and occasionally a second superconducting transition at still lower temperature, and contacts with the weakest superconductor Zn have strongly reduced superconducting anomalies. We propose that this variation is related to the magnetic field generated by the ferromagnetic electrode, which can also affect the extracted spin polarization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Andreev Reflection; Metal Interfaces; Point Contacts; Spin Polarization; Ferromagnetic Materials; Ferromagnetism; Iron Metallography; Point Contacts; Spin Polarization; Andreev Reflection; Critical Temperatures; Ferromagnetic Electrodes; Literature Data; Lower Temperatures; Metal Interface; Superconducting Transitions; Superconductor Interface; Superconducting Materials","Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Iron metallography; Point contacts; Spin polarization; Andreev reflection; Critical temperatures; Ferromagnetic electrodes; Literature data; Lower temperatures; Metal interface; Superconducting transitions; Superconductor interface; Superconducting materials","","Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","00222291; 15737357","","JLTPA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921948930"

During irradiation tests with protons of 65 MeV at the cyclotron of Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), 1.4 GeV at the CERN ISOLDE facility, and 24 GeV at the CERN IRRAD1 facility, the superconductor samples become radioactive and their handling must follow the legal specifications for radioactive materials. We have estimated the activation and the resulting ambient dose equivalent rate up to a fluence of 1017p/cm2 with the Monte-Carlo Code FLUKA. The estimates were verified with experimental activation spectra. Samples for magnetization measurements with a mass of approximately 20 mg have to be considered as radioactive, but they do not have the potential to harm the operators handling them at radiation levels below 1 μSv/h. Larger samples (longer wires and sample holder materials like Cu and TiAl6V4) show correspondingly higher ambient dose equivalent rates and activation levels and they must be handled by radiation workers in designated areas, taking into account the standard precautions for work with radioactive materials.

The origin of the problem resides in the microstructure of the Ta and the code formation mechanics of relatively strong BCC Ta with weaker and more ductile adjacent FCC Cu. In an attempt to remedy this problem, we have processed 25 mm square bars of Ta by multi-axis severe plastic deformation (SPD) via equal channel angular extrusion, then rolled the bars to sheet and annealed the as-worked sheet.

The non-Cu critical current densities now approach 3000 A/mm2 at 12 T and 4.2 K in engineering quality strand. The design of new strands minimizes the amount of Cu in the package from which the Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn is formed and increases the Sn level beyond that required to simply achieve A15 stoichiometry. The result is an A15 layer that is significantly more uniform than earlier generations of wire, both chemically and microstructurally, and wires that significantly surpasses previous Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn strands in layer critical current density and in the specific grain boundary pinning force. Remarkably, these developments have been achieved in internal Sn based strands manufactured using both the modified jelly-roll technique with Nb-Ti alloy and the rod-in-tube approach with Nb-Ta alloy. The rod-in-tube approach is particularly exciting because it offers greater manufacturing flexibility. Advances have also been made in strand designs that offer the potential to reduce the large effective filament diameters, which are an issue with these new high-J <inf>c</inf> strands.

Preparation of fine and uniform size Ta powders plays a key role in the fabrication of filamentary (Nb, Ta)<inf>3</inf>Sn conductors. In this study, Ta hydride (TaH) is used as a starting material to prepare fine Ta powder. TaH flakes are crushed into powders by a ball mill (BM) in Ar atmosphere. Commercial - 325 mesh Ta powders so far used contain large particles ∼20 μm in diameter, the average particle size being 1.7 μm. Meanwhile the TaH (BM) powder is much finer and more uniform, the average particle size being 0. 46 μm. The TaH (BM) and - 325 mesh Ta powder are mixed with - 325 mesh Sn powder, and reacted at 950°C for 10 h in vacuum to synthesize Ta-Sn core powder. In this treatment the dehydrization of TaH(BM) may proceed simultaneously. These powders are encased in Nb-4at%Ta tube and fabricated into a mono-core tape. A homogeneous Ta-Sn core is obtained after the fabrication when the TaH(BM) powder is used. Resulting tapes are heat-treated to form (Nb, Ta)<inf>3</inf>Sn layer. A small amount of Cu addition to the core is effective in reducing the heat-treatment temperature. Transition temperature of the tape does not degrade when the TaH(BM) powder is used. Nearly the same high-field performance is obtained in the TaH (BM) powder core tape as that of - 325 mesh Ta powder core tape.

The mechanism of the formation of thick Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn layers by the reaction has been studied. No stable compound richer in Sn exists in the Ta-Sn system, and Sn has stronger affinity to Nb than to Ta. Furthermore, Nb in the sheath diffuses into the core at the reaction. These seem to be possible origins for the enhancement of the diffusion of Sn from the core to the sheath synthesizing thick Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn layers. Ta in the core is incorporated into the Nb<inf>3</inf>Sn layer at the reaction. Subsequently, the effect of the Cu addition to the Ta-Sn core of the composite has been studied.

Tcoordination is trigonal prismatic in| TS 2 | sandwich, which is very similar to those of 2H-TS 2 structures. X-ray diffraction of each type of slab shows that one intralayer lattice parameter of| MS| slab is incommensurate with the corresponding one of a| TS 2 | slab. Both layers are then commensurate along the stacking axis and one perpendicular direction, and misfitted in any other direction.

Removal of the azide or replacement of the azide by chloride had no qualitative effect.

T., Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, United States","Superior superconducting properties, such as high Jc's, and Tc’s, have been obtained from reacted liquid-infiltrated Nb-Sn composite wires. These excellent properties. are attributed to the chemistry and structure of the material, which is prepared by a unique solid (Nb) - liquid (Sn) reaction. From heat capacity measurements, sharp bulk superconducting transitions of the A15 phase occur at 17.2-18 K and the weight fraction of A15 in the composite wire is ~23%. Analytical electron microscopy techniques have shown that: the microstructure of these conductors consists of alternating large-grain and small-grain filaments; these two types of filaments correspond to BCC Nb(Sn) and cubic A15 Nb75±xSn25+xphases, respectively; the A15 filaments (<0.5 µm) are chemically homogeneous in terms of measured X-ray intensity ratios to within ± 7%, which implies that x ~1.5; and the A15 grains are essentially free of extended lattice disorder down to a resolution of ~0.34 nm. Recent work in which Nb is alloyed with Ta has shown that these superconducting properties can be improved upon; e.g. high overall Jc's of ~1.8x 104A/cm2 at 20 T and 4.2 K have been measured. Also, the liquid-infiltrated Nb(Ta) -Sn composites have a damage strain tolerance nearly double that of commercial bronze-processed Nb-Sn conductors.

The surface resistance r <inf>s</inf>, as given by Pippard, is exceedingly small for Sn, Pb, and other pure metals below about 0.95 T<inf>c</inf> at these frequencies. As a consequence, trapped-flux effects provide the dominant losses in rolled-foil resonant circuits. The theoretical model is simply Ohmic losses in the normal regions of trapped fluxoids bounded by the penetration depth and the surface. This gives an added resistance r<inf>h</inf>=r<inf>h</inf>(0)V(t), where the temperature function is V(t) = (1-t4)-1/2(1-t 2)-1. The magnitude of the loss is predicted to be proportional to the density of fluxoids trapped, which in turn is assumed proportional to the background magnetic field for low fields. The experimental technique consisted of pulse determinations of circuit Q in the superconducting and normal state as a function of temperature and weak background magnetic field on cooling below T<inf>c</inf>. The most detailed effort was made on pure tin foil from 60-350 MHz with background H fields up to 6 G. Data on these and on SnSingle Bond signIn, PbSingle Bond signSn, Ta, and Nb samples showed the function V(t) gave the best fit. The flux-trapping loss was linearly proportional to the cooling field. The Pippard surface-resistance term was separated out along with a very small residual loss, r<inf>0</inf>. The latter was independent of field or temperature and could be annealed out. The Pippard term had a frequency dependence between ν4/3 and ν3/2 as expected. These results differed from Haden et al. in that no break in the decay rate was observed in the pure Sn circuits. This could be explained by the absence of an observable fluxoid core transition. The absence of a strong frequency dependence is consistent with Ohmic loss and ruled out a dominant hysteresis behavior. The nature of the flux-trapping loss is seen to make it the principle dissipating mechanism for most circuit applications since it resists annealing, does not depend upon impurities, and even though greatly reduced by nulling out external fields, may be partially self-induced due to thermoelectric effects on cooling. © 1968 The American Institute of Physics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","10897550; 00218979","0883182955; 0883184419; 0883184133","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36849106226"

It has been shown in many experiments that the critical supercurrent through a pair of such contacts in a parallel superconducting circuit has a component periodic in the flux enclosed by the topological ring formed by the parallel circuit, the periodicity being h2e, showing that the wave function is coherent around the ring. With this configuration we have demonstrated coherence lengths of the order of millimeters or centimeters in Nb, V, Ta, Sn, Pb, and Nb0.85 Zr0.15, in rings where the enclosed area was as large as 1 cm2, so that the periodicity in applied field was of the order of 10-7 G. Both bulk and thin-film materials have been used. These experiments provide general proof of London's concept of long-range phase coherence in both type-I and type-II superconductors, and in addition lead to useful laboratory instruments. We have used such devices to show quantized flux pinning in bulk type-II superconductors and to measure the magnetic field of a rotating superconductor. © 1966 The American Physical Society. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","0031899X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000668771"

The temperature dependence of the I:V characteristics for sandwiches of Ta/barrier/Pb and Nb/barrier/Sn has been studied and the energy gaps of tin and tantalum determined up to their transition temperatures. Good agreement has been obtained between the temperature dependence observed experimentally, and the predictions of the Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The full limiting values of the superconducting energy gaps obtained are 2 Nb=(3.05 0.05)×10-3 eV, 2 Ta=(1.40 0.05)×10-3 eV, and 2 Sn=(1.150.06)×10-3 eV. The lead apparently exhibited two prominent energy gaps with values of 2 Pb(1)=(2.67 0.05)×10-3 eV and 2 Pb(2)=(2.90 0.05)×10-3 eV, at 0°K. This behavior is tentatively ascribed to anisotropy. Theoretical characteristics have been computed, using the BCS density-of-states expression, =E(E2-2)12, and compared with the experimental results. Possible reasons for the deviations observed are discussed. © 1962 The American Physical Society. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","0031899X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0344021735"

Using the onset of the main absorption edge as a measure of the energy gap, the values of Eg(0), the energy gap at absolute zero, were found to be 4.1±0.2 kTc for indium, 3.6±0.2 kTc for tin, 4.6±0.2 kTc for mercury, â:3.0 kTc for tantalum, 3.4±0.2 kTc for vanadium, 4.1±0.2 kTc for lead, and 2.8±0.3 kTc for niobium. The deviations of these values of the energy gap from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer value of 3.5 kTc are a fairly smooth function of the Debye temperature alone, but a less smooth one of the ratio of the Debye temperature to the critical temperature. Structure was found on the absorption curves of lead and mercury. Its interpretation is discussed in terms of possible states in the gap, anisotropy of the gap, and of a possible dielectric anomaly. The position of the main absorption edge seemed to scale with temperature according to the temperature dependence of the energy gap predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, and the structure appeared to have a roughly similar temperature dependence. The absorption curves for pure superconductors are compared with predictions based on the theory of the skin effect in the normal and superconducting states. Two alloy superconductors were measured. They appeared to have less well-defined gaps than the pure superconductors. © 1960 The American Physical Society. © 2007 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","0031899X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000168444"
